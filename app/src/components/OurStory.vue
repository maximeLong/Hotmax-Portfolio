          Hotmax is comprised of builders and designers in interactive media, who came together at the start of 2017 to create a lab where our ideas could be developed and published.
          <br>
          Collectively, we've built applications ranging from <span @click="openProjectWindow(projectWindows.curriculum)">interactive textbooks</span> to <span @click="openProjectWindow(projectWindows.arSynth)">augmented reality synthesizers</span>.

        <div class="text">
          <div>We have a philosophy of exploration, connecting aspects of different interactive media in novel ways.</div>
          <div>Weâ€™re currently exploring two ideas in greater detail:</div>
          <ul>
            <li>The benefits that AR and VR can provide in existing industry software.</li>
            <li>How giving users meaningful choices and engaging them in intelligent ways, as formalized in video game design, can enhance user retention in other interactive media.</li>

          Hotmax was founded in 2017 by Andy Katsikapes and Maxime Long.

            <div>Andy studied music at the Cornish College of the Arts and speaks fluent Japanese.
              He has been designing sound for the better half of his life.
              When asked what his goal in life is he said, "I want to make a mixed reality synthesizer that brings the musician into the machine".</div>
            <div>Hopefully someday we will actually know what that means.</div>
